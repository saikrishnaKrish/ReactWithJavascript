"# ReactWithJavascript" 



React is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries to build front-end applications, but before starting it, we should give some time to understand the optimal design structure of a react application.

ReactJs.org has officially mentioned some key points and principles that should be highly considered while creating react applications.

They are - Component Composition, Common Abstraction, Escape Hatches, Stability, Interoperability, Scheduling, Developer Experience, Debugging, Configuration, Beyond the DOM, Implementation, Optimized for tooling, and Dogfooding.

Component Composition simply states the core fundamental principle of react, that every react application is a combination of various small useful components composed together.

It also states that the react components should be reusable, convenient to understand, and easy to debug.

Dividing a complex UI into several components helps greatly in avoiding code repetition and improves the performance of the overall application by significant times.
